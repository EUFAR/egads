CHANGELOG | LINEAGE BRANCH
==========================

To do list:
-----------
  - check feasability of an online algorithm database.
  - add function to create algorithm template.
  - add function to add a folder, somewhere on the hard drive, to the list of algorithms.

To fix list:
------------


December 18 2023, Release version 1.2.9
=======================================
  ADDED:
    * two new formats have been added to netcdf classes.


January 6 2021, Release version 1.2.8
=====================================
  FIXED:
    - in EgadsNetCdf class, when writing data to file, attributes were added to the variable after the creation of the variable and addition of data. This leads to an issue with add_offset and scale_factor attributes. Now attributes are added after the creation of the variable and before the addition of data, fixing the issue.
  
  ADDED:
    - two parameters have been added to NetCdf class / _write_variable method, scale_factor and add_offset, to offer the user the possibility to use them even if the class EgadsNetCdf is not used.


July 15 2020, Release version 1.2.7
===================================
The results of the following functions get_variable_list(), get_group_list() and get_dimension_list() for Hdf and NetCdf classes is the same type whatever the option used in each function. Now if details = True, get_variable_list() and get_group_list() return a list of string, each string is composed of the path to the group/variable + group/variable name. get_dimension_list() returns a dictionary of keys, composed of the path to the dimension + the dimension name, and values composed of the size of the dimension. It is the same schema than the one before 1.2.0.


  MODIFIED:
	- if an attribute is empty but exist in a file, it is now kept in EgadsData, and it can be written to a new file.
	- in NasaAmes class, scale_factor and missing value have been removed from EgadsData metadata as they don't exist in NA file.
	- get_variable_list() in Hdf and NetCdf classes returns a list of string. If details = True, each string is composed of the path to the variable + the variable name.
	- get_group_list() in Hdf and NetCdf classes returns a list of string. If details = True, each string is composed of the path to the group + the group name.
	- get_dimension_list() in Hdf and NetCdf classes returns a dictionary with keys as dimension name and values as dimension size. If details = True, each key is composed of the path to the dimension + the dimension name.

  FIXED:
    - in Hdf file, attribute created by H5py ['DIMENSION_LABELS', 'NAME', 'CLASS', 'REFERENCE_LIST', 'DIMENSION_LIST'] were transfered to EgadsData. It has been fixed.
	- with Hdf file, variables at the root of the file have a path equal to '/', like netcdf file.
	- test units have been fixed.


May 7 2020, Release version 1.2.6
=================================
  FIXED:
    - as H5py can't handle attributes with values containing great numbers, EgadsHdf has been modified to handle fill values with great number.
	- fixed an issue with numpy.where when handling fill values.


May 6 2020, Release version 1.2.5
=================================
  MODIFIED:
	- consistency was improved between get_dimension_list() function in NetCdf and Hdf classes.

  MODIFIED:
    - the read_variable function in hdf_io.py has been modified, now if a missing value attribute is missing, a warning is displayed in the log, but no exception is raised.
	
  ADDED:
    - the get_group_list function has been added to hdf_io.py


April 1 2020, Release version 1.2.3
===================================
  FIXED:
    - fixed an issue with variables at the root of the netcdf file if the function get_variable_list is used with options group_walk and details as True.
	- fixed an issue with leading / when adding dim with dim name in netcdf file.

  MODIFIED:

December 11 2019, Release version 1.2.0
=======================================
EGADS can read and write HDF5 file format, following or not EUFAR convention.
Group function has been added to the NetCdf and EgadsNetCdf classes. The conversion to NasaAmes from NetCdf using the dedicated function is not compatible with groups.

=======================================
  MODIFIED:
    - improved the function to reload user-defined algorithms.
	

September 5 2019, Release version 1.1.1
=======================================
  MODIFIED:
    - a new function has been introduced to reload all user-defined algorithms. It is not intended to be used directly in a script, but by the GUI when a user creates an algorithm via the dedicated window. The move of all files created by EGADS in the $HOME directory leads to difficulties with the GUI and this solution is now used until a better solution is found.


September 4 2019, Release version 1.1.0
=======================================
The configuration file and user algorithm structure have been moved to a dedicated directory in the $HOME folder (Windows, Linux and MacOS), to avoid issues when Python is installed in a system folder. Read the documentation for more details.


August 14 2019, Release version 1.0.3
=====================================
  FIXED:
    - a right parenthesis in a logging message was missing in the code to create the user algorithm structure and this could lead to an error.


August 12 2019, Release version 1.0.2
=====================================
  FIXED:
    - the pathlib module wasn't imported in the egads_utils fonction.


August 12 2019, Release version 1.0.1
=====================================
  FIXED:
    - if the path to the log is incorrectly set, it leads to a file not found error at startup. Now if the path is not valid, egads will use the default path and log a message.
	
  ADDED:
    - logging message added to the EgadsNasaAmes class


July 17 2019, Release version 1.0.0
===================================
EGADS is now mature enough to leave the beta phase and be released as a stable module.

  ADDED:
    - if an error occurres during the loading of an algorithm, the reason is now displayed in the log file.
	- an attribute has been added to inform if the module has been frozen by PyInstaller.
	- if EGADS is frozen, the update system is disabled.


July 03 2019, Release version 0.9.6
===================================
  FIXED:
    - requests was imported without a try: except: code in egads_update function. It has been fixed.
	- when missing values exist in a netcdf or nasa ames file and if the option 'read_as_float' is True, it is not possible to convert those missing values to float (numpy masked array). It has been fixed.


June 12 2019, Release version 0.9.5
===================================
In order to follow the EUFAR convention, and NetCDF classes examples, the NasaAmes class has been divided into two classes: NasaAmes and EgadsNasaAmes. EgadsNasaAmes class returns EgadsData instance when reading data, and it asks for EgadsData instance when writing data.

  FIXED:
    - when reading a NASA Ames file, the convention wasn't set correctly (str, but the class is asking for a list)
	
  MODIFIED:
    - NasaAmes class has been divided into two classes: NasaAmes and EgadsNasaAmes classes.
	- the documentation has been updated.
  
  ADDED:
    - a new folder with functions to create user algorithm structure, logging system and options dictionary has been added.


June 7 2019, Release version 0.9.4
==================================
  MODIFIED:
    - a doc string has been modified in netcdf_io.py to show that the add_attribute function accepts different type of value.
	- when saving variables in a nasa ames files, if the user enter a name for each variable, it will be used instead of the standard_name or long_name of the EgadsData class.
	- as the nasa_ames_io class is working only for FFI 1001, the independant variable is now stored directly in the na_dict and not in a list (as for usual variables).
	- the save_na_file function has been modified to take into account integers and floats numbers. Now by default, floats numbers are saved will all decimal numbers if float_format is not entered.
	- if an attribute is added to a variable in a new or an existing netcdf file, and if the attribute is a list, it is automatically converted to a string with the elements of the list separated by a ', '.
	- values coming from a NASA Ames file and injected into an EgadsData class will have the right format (int32, float64, ...) and not only float.
	- the documentation has been updated.
	- the function convert_to_nasa_ames of the EgadsNetcdf and NetCdf classes has been modified to take into account improvements brought to the NasaAmes class.
	- when reading a variable from a nasa ames files, data were stored in a list then in an EgadsData
	
  FIXED:
    - old python2 code has been found and removed.
	- the na_dict object wasn't well passed between functions in the nasa_ames_io class.
	- in the nasa_ames_io class, if default value is used, integers (ex: 1) are now real integers in the file and not floats (ex: 1.0).
	- few typos in the documentation.
	- in the convert_to_nasa_ames function of the netcd_io classes, few metadata were embedded in lists. It has been fixed.
  
  ADDED:
    - because of the limitation of Numpy with integers and NaN, an option has been introduce to let the user choose if data has to be read as float when reading a file.
	- for NetCDF (EgadsNetCdf class) and NasaAmes (NasaAmes class) files, the option 'replace_fill_value' has been added to read variables. If the option 'replace_fill_value' is True, EGADS will replace automatically values set in '_FillValue' or 'missing_value' attributes by numpy.nan. By default the option is False.
	- a _FillValue attribute is added to the algorithm output IF one of the inputs has a _FillValue or missing value attribute.


May 9 2019, Release version 0.9.3
=================================
  MODIFIED:
    - the documentation of an algorithm has been modified for better understanding in EGADS GUI.
	- the code has been cleaned thanks to PyCharm.
	- few logging messages have been modified.
	- egads functions to set and read options have been modified for better handling.
	- the user algorithm default folders are now created in EGADS init. This way it is possible to uninstall or update EGADS without loosing the algorithms created by users.
	- the thread to check egads update has been a bit modified to remove the use of importlib.
	- the documentation has been updated.
  
  ADDED:
    - the unit psu (Practical Salinity Unit) has been added in EGADS. EGADS should be able to handle it correctly, when the unit is coded as 'psu' or as '0.001'.
	- few logging messages have been added.
	- code to test the CompareParamLcss algorithm has been added.
	- the algorithm template in the documentation has been corrected.
  
  FIXED:
    - an issue (a mispelled variable) has been corrected in the CompareParamLcss algorithm, leading to a crash of EGADS.
	- changed log path to EGADS module path by default.


October 1 2018, Release version 0.9.2
=====================================
  MODIFIED:
    - the setup.py file has been modify to include a link to the online documentation on ReadTheDocs.

    
October 1 2018, Release version 0.9.1
=====================================
  MODIFIED:
    - the result of the function 'get_dimension_list()' in the 'NetCDF' class has been changed from a standard dictionary to an OrderedDict from collections to keep the original distribution of dimensions in the opened netcdf file.
    - as the netcdf library returns an OrderedDict when asking for a list of variables, the OrderedDict is changed into a list in EGADS.
    - the branch version has been added to the '_version.py' file.
  

July 26 2018, Release version 0.9.0
====================================
EGADS Lineage has been converted for Python 3.5.x and above. As Nappy is not yet compatible with Python 3, it has been discarded and replaced by a homemade function. Quantities has been removed from third party folder, now to use EGADS it must be installed as a usual python package.

  FIXED:
    - few lines of code for testing purpose were still in the EGADS official test section. They have been removed.
	- the function to compute the iso format for time has been fixed: a dictionnary was used for iso format interpretation and gave wrong result in few particular situations.

    - fixed an issue with delimiter in NasaAmes class.
	
  MODIFIED:
    - simplified the code of few EGADS functions.
    - few unecessary functions have been removed.
    - 'U' has been added for string encoding in the 'parse_string_array' function.
	- if the seek function is used with the parameter 1 for 'current' on an ascii file not opened in binary mode, an exception will be raised.
	- for consistency, the type (scalar, vector, array) of the output of an algorithm is now based on the metadata 'OutputTypes' of the algorithm.
    - the function _get_dimension_list in the NasaAmes class has been modified to display dimensions based on the independant variable (FFI1001).
    - automatic update check has been disabled until I understand how branches work on Github ;o).
    - when reading a NASA Ames file, SCOM and NCOM attributes are now stored in a NA Dict as a string with '\n' to delimit lines (no conversion, before each line of a comment was converted into a list). A user can create SCOM and NCOM as string with '\n' for newlines, or provide a list of line, when creating a new NASA Ames file.
    - logging messages have been cleaned for a better understanding.
    - the documentation has been updated.
    
  ADDED:
    - a new function to read/write NASA Ames files has been introduced. For now, only reading/writing capabilities for FFI 1001 have been developed. It is possible to save NASA Ames file as csv by giving a delimiter.

  MODIFIED:
    - the documentation has been updated.


March 24 2017, Release version 0.8.0
====================================
  FIXED:
    - if a user wants to rescale an EgadsData object (unit 1 to unit 2), the metadata attribute disappears. It has been fixed and metadata are passed to the new EgadsData object, with the necessary modifications.
    - if a user wants to slice an EgadsData object, the metadata attribute disappears. It has been fixed.
    - the EgadsNetCdf class was searching in the EgadsData object for metadata attributes to save a variable in a NetCDF file. In the EgadsNetCdf and NetCdf classes, once a NetCDF file is open, all metadata are stored in only one attribute, a dictionary, '.metadata'. That attribute wasn't taking into acount and that leads to a crash of the EgadsNetCdf class when trying to write a variable. It has been fixed, and EgadsNetCdf class now uses the '.metadata' dictionary to retrieve metadata.
    - the logging system wasn't logging Nappy and Quantities imports properly.
    - fixed an error in the NasaAmes class when trying to get a list of all variables in a new NA dictionary.

    - the functions to write data in a NASA Ames dictionary has been modified to include exceptions on metadata.


January 24 2017, Release version 0.7.1
======================================
The IOP Model and Algorithms package provided by the Plymouth Marine Laboratory was a part of the EGADS package. But it has never been integrated in EGADS. Since it needs few libraries and is not compatible with windows, it has been removed from EGADS package and it is now available through its own webpage on the EUFAR website (http://www.eufar.net/software-tools/tool/pml-inherent-optical-property-model-l-edimlolpo) and on GitHub (https://github.com/eufarn7sp/pml-wq).

The function interfaced with Nappy to read NASA/Ames files has been rewritten. It as been simplified and it is now possible to write NA files. Conversion of NA files to netcdf files, and in the other way, is not possible for now.
  

December 1 2015 - 4 January 2016
================================
  EGADS version is currently 0.5.8. It appears to have critical issues with Nappy, as this one calls old numpy functions which have been discarded from newer versions.
