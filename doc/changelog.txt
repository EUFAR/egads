CHANGELOG
=========


December 1 2016, Release version 0.5.5
=======================================
  Few fixes have been introduced in the Nappy library. The functions to interface EGADS with Nappy have been rewritten but are still in early stage. Use with caution.
  


December 1 2015 - 4 January 2016
================================
  First design of the new GUI dedicated to EGADS.
  EGADS version is currently 0.5.8. It appears to have critical issues with Nappy, as this one calls old numpy functions which have been discarded from newer versions.
