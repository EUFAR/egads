CHANGELOG
=========


January 23 2017, Release version 0.7.0
======================================
  FIXED:
    - an issue with the LinearInterpolation algorithm has been fixed. 
    - an issue (missing factor) has been fixed in the algorithm to compute an effective diameter of a size distribution (Microphysics algorithms).
    - the get_description attribute of EgadsData class wasn't working properly (KeyError), it has been fixed.
    - the validating function for units was crashing if the unit for time was 'xxxx since xxxxx' or composed of multiple words. It has been fixed
    - fixed few small issues in EgadsCsv class.
    - fixed few typographical errors in EGADS and algorithms documentations.
    
  ADDED:
    - test functions to test Corrections, Mathematics and Transforms algorithms have been added.
    - test functions to test Microphysics algorithms have been added.
    - test functions to test Radiations algorithms have been added.
    - an algorithm (available in the algorithm handbook) to compute dynamic pressure, angle of attack and sideslip has been added in EGADS. It must be reviewed.
    - a new algorithm has been created based on the old LinearInterpolation algorithm. The old algorithm is still available for compatibility reasons.
    - a logging system has been added to monitor the stability of EGADS.
    - a function has been added to change dynamically the logging level.
    - error messages has been added to the Metadata class during convention check.
    - error messages has been added when a user try to open a text or csv file.
    - a config file (egads.ini) has been introduced for logging options and future needs.
    - a function has been introduced to update logging options.
    
  MODIFIED:
    - the computation of delta_T has been added in the Solar Vector Calculation algorithm (solar_vector_reda.py).
    - the documentation of algorithms has been updated.
    - the documentation of EGADS has been updated.


December 16 2016, Release version 0.6.0
=======================================
  FIXED:
    - few issues have been fixed in the test functions.
    - few tests to check netcdf functions have been fixed for a problem with opening file.
    - few issues have been fixed in the Sphinx documentation.
    
  ADDED:
    - a function to test EGADS metadata class has been included.
    - two functions to test EGADS NASA/Ames support have been included.
    - tex files for algorithms documentation have been included in EGADS package.
    
  MODIFIED:
    - the function to test the conversion capabilities of EGADS has been deactived for now.
    - the netcdf function to open nc file has been modified to take into account errors reported by Windows and not only linux.
    - the documentation for EGADS and algorithms has been updated.


December 1 2016, Release version 0.5.9
======================================
  Few fixes have been introduced in EGADS to make it compatible with Windows. The functions to interface EGADS with Nappy is old, a bug linked to the new Numpy version has been fixed. The function interfaced with Nappy to read NASA/Ames files has been rewritten. It as been simplified and it is now possible to write NA files. Conversion of NA files to netcdf files, and in the other way, is not possible for now.
  


December 1 2015 - 4 January 2016
================================
  EGADS version is currently 0.5.8. It appears to have critical issues with Nappy, as this one calls old numpy functions which have been discarded from newer versions.
