CHANGELOG
=========


July XX 2016, Release version 0.8.0
=======================================
  Matplotlib package is used to generate all figures. A logging system has been introduced.
  As more bugs have been found in Nappy and to prevent future compatibility issues, a new function to read and write NASA Ames format will be coded.
  Since version 0.7.0, EGADS and EGADS gui are divided into two entities based on the operating system : EGADS for Windows and EGADS for Linux.
  
  ADDED:
    - a simple function to plot data has been introduced.
    - a new plot window with custom icons has been designed. It has been connected to the official Matplotlib API.
    - figure options have been added to the plot window.
    - the user has the possibility to generate single plot or multiple subplots.
    - figure options have been expanded to include subplots.
    - plot options have been introduced to the plot window.
    - a new function has been added to EGADS core to add new units not available in Quantities

  FIXED:
    - EGADS core couldn't process correctly variable units if the unit is 'unicode' and not 'str'.
    - EGADS core couldn't process correclty time units if the unit is composed of 'time' (seconds, minutes, hours, ...) and ' since xxxxx'.
    - as the netcdf gui function changed, the closing function wasn't cleaning the GUI properly.
    - fixed a bug with set_linestyle, markers weren't displayed correctly
    - the deletion of two or more variables brings a TypeError. It has been fixed
    - during the creation of a new variable through the process window, the dimensions of the new variable wasn't set correctly. It has been fixed
    - once a new variable is created and selected in the new variables tab, the icon to migrate the variable is not enabled. It has been fixed
    - if a new variable is created with a list as Category metadata, the variable couldn't be saved. It has been fixed.
    - if multiple time series are displayed in the same plot window, clearing the window bring an error and doesn't clean all options, this has been fixed.


February 16 2016, Release version 0.7.0
=======================================
  As Nappy, a module for python, calls CDMS2, it is incompatible with Window for now. A test with Pyinstaller for Linux is a success. A solution will be found for Windows.
  
  FIXED:
    - in the variable metadata window, if "show other attributes" is clicked two times (to show and to hide), once Save is clicked, the program crashes. It has been fixed.
    - a temporary solution has been found to allow Quantities module to correctly read CF1.0 time unit format. The modification has been introduced in "egads_core.py"
    
  ADDED:
    - a function to delete a variable has been introduced.
    - a function to apply an algorithm (just one) has been introduced to prepare the introduction of new variables. Applying an algorithm create a new workspace to store new variables.
    - a function to migrate new varibles to the main workspace.
    - a new window to allow processing operations has been introduced.
    - new metadata have been added to all algorithms : input type (vector, scalar, time, ...), input description, output description, purpose and description. Those modifications have been made to allow a user to know all caracteritics of an algorithm.
    - info boxes have been added to the processing window.
    - the number of input and output object in the processing window depends now on the metadata of the algorithm.
    - information about the selected algorithm are displayed in the processing window
    - the processing window can now handle multiple coefficients for one LineEdit.
    - in the processing window, the "Save" button will be available only if all fields have been filled in. Optionnal fields are not taken into account to activate the "Save" button.
    - a function and a window to display a variable has been introduced.
    - the processing window is now linked with the "new variable" tab and functional.
    - algorithms with multiple outputs are now managed by the processing window.
    
  MODIFIED:
    - the function to save a file has been modified to allow proper operation once a variable has been deleted.
    - the GUI has been modified to allow proper operations with new variables.
    - the gui can handle modification/deletion/addition of metadata linked to new variables
    - the gui can handle multiple categories for the Category metadata.
    - a new stylesheet has been used for the processing window.
    - in the processing window, for an algorithm, if an input is optional, a default message is added to the information window.


January 25 2016, Release version 0.6.0
======================================
  Two incompatibilites with the latest version of Numpy have been found in Nappy. Until the official fix, a modified nappy is proposed with EGADS.
  First version of the main GUI.
  
  ADDED:
    - a function to open netcdf files has been introduced, with all needed functions to feed the gui and close the file.
    - a function to save netcdf files to netcdf, NASA Ames and csv format has been introduced.
    - a function to read NASA Ames files has been introduced, with all needed functions to feed the gui and close the file.
    - it is now possible to save a NASA Ames file to netcdf file using the dedicated nappy API.
    - a list of variables is shown in the dedicated tab.
    - metadata (global and linked to variables) are now displayed in the GUI.
    - the status bar is fed with information (file name, file size, conventions)
    - it is now possible to modify the global metadata directly in the GUI.
    - it is now possible to modify the variable metadata directly in the GUI.
    - a new window to modify global metadata (accessible via an icon in the toolbar) has been added.
    - it is possible to add, modify and delete metadata through the new global metadata window.

  MODIFIED:
    - if a variable is selected, and a metadata has been modified before, it will now reflect the modification of the metadata even if another variable is selected.
    - if a variable is selected, and a metadata is modified but not saved, selecting another variable will cancel the modication.
    - the function to save netcdf also save the modified metadata.


December 1 2015 - 4 January 2016
================================
  First design of the new GUI dedicated to EGADS.
  EGADS version is currently 0.5.8. It appears to have critical issues with Nappy, as this one calls old numpy functions which have been discarded from newer versions.
