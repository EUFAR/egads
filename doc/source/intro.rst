Introduction

The EGADS (EUFAR General Airborne Data-processing Software) package is a Python-based 
library of processing and file I/O routines designed to help analyze a wide range of 
airborne atmospheric science data. EGADS' purpose is to provide a benchmark for airborne 
data-processing through its community-provided algorithms, and to act as a reference 
by providing guidance to researchers with an open-source design and well-documented 
processing routines.

Python is used in development of EGADS due to its straightforward syntax and  
portability between systems. Users interact with data processing 
algorithms using the Python command-line or by creating Python scripts for 
more complex tasks. The core of EGADS is built upon a data structure that 
encapsulates data and metadata into a single object. This simplifies the housekeeping 
of data and metadata and allows these data to be easily passed 
between algorithms and data files. Algorithms in EGADS also contain metadata 
elements that allow data and their sources to be tracked through processing chains.
