These are the Water Quality algorithms developed by PML under the scope of the EUAFR project. These algorithms will eventually be fully integrated into the EGADS package.

Note that these algorithms are currently compiled and tested to work on 64bit Linux systems. Use on other systems has not been tested and cannot be guaranteed.
