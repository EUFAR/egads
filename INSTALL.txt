EGADS Lineage Installation
==========================

Information about EGADS Lineage and the latest release can be found at: https://github.com/EUFAR/egads/tree/Lineage and https://pypi.org/project/egads-lineage/
Documentation about EGADS Lineage can be found at https://egads.readthedocs.io/en/lineage/index.html and in the Documentation folder.


Important information
=====================
EGADS Lineage is not developed under the scope of EUFAR. It is maintained by Olivier Henry. Its main difference is the compatibility with Python 3.


Prerequisites
=============
To use EGADS Lineage, the following packages must be installed:

 1. Python 3.5 or newer.
 
 2. Numpy 1.14 or newer.

 4. Python netCDF4 libraries 1.3.0 or newer
 
 5. H5py 2.10 or newer
 
 5. Quantities 0.12.1 or newer

 6. python_dateutil 2.6.1 or newer.
 
 7. Requests 2.18.4 or newer. Optional, only to check updates (if activated by the user).


Installation
============
EGADS is a pure Python distribution, thus, it does not need to built. However, to use it, it must be installed to a location on the Python path. To install EGADS (assuming priviledged user rights), run the following command from the EGADS Lineage directory:

  python setup.py install
or
  pip install egads-lineage

To install as an unpriviledged user, or to install to a directory of your choosing, the following command can be used:

  python setup.py install --prefix MYDIR

For information on other install options the --help option can be used:

  python setup.py install --help

On Linux systems, the installation of EGADS in the user home directory is encouraged to ensure the proper operation of the EGADS logging system.

If EGADS requirements in term of dependecies are full filled and/or if the user wants to avoid their installation, the use of the following option is encouraged:

  python setup.py install --no-dep
or
  pip install egads --no-dep


Testing
=======

To test the EGADS installation, from within Python, run the following commands:

  >>> import egads
  >>> egads.test()
  
On Linux, if issues occure with NetCDF4 or H5py, please check the last section of this file for a possible solution.


Uninstallation
============
Just run the following command from your terminal:

  pip uninstall egads-lineage
or
  remove manually all folders in you Python site-packages folder containing egads name.

In the $HOME directory, delete .egads_lineage directory if you don't want to keep options and logs of EGADS Lineage.


Issues with NetCDF4 and/or H5py on a Linux distribution
=======================================================
If NetCDF4 and H5py libraries are installed through Pypi, a crash can occure when trying to read/write a netcdf or an hdf file. Here are the different steps to fix that particular issue:

 1. Uninstall entirely NetCDF4
 2. Download NetCDF4 sources corresponding to the same version
 3. Unzip the package, launch a terminal and build NetCDF4 module -> python setup.py build
 4. Finally install NetCDF4 module -> python setup.py install
 5. Check NetCDF4 integration into EGADS with EGADS test function
