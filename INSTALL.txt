==========================

Information about EGADS Lineage and the latest release can be found at: https://github.com/EUFAR/egads/tree/Lineage and https://pypi.org/project/egads-lineage/
Documentation about EGADS Lineage can be found at: https://no-website-yet and in EGADS Lineage package.


Important information
=====================
EGADS Lineage is not developed under the scope of EUFAR. It is maintained by Olivier Henry. Its main difference is the compatibility with Python 3.


Prerequisites
=============
To use EGADS Lineage, the following packages must be installed:

 1. Python 3.5 or newer.
 
 2. Numpy 1.14 or newer.

 3. Scipy 1.00 or newer.

 4. Python netCDF4 libraries 1.3.0 or newer
 
 5. Quantities 0.12.1 or newer

 6. python_dateutil 2.6.1 or newer.
 
 7. Requests 2.18.4 or newer. Optional, only for update checking.


Installation
============
EGADS is a pure Python distribution, thus, it does not need to built. However,
to use it, it must be installed to a location on the Python path. To install
EGADS (assuming priviledged user rights), run the following command from the EGADS Lineage directory:

  python setup.py install
or
  pip install egads-lineage

To install as an unpriviledged user, or to install to a directory of your choosing, the following command can be used:

  python setup.py install --prefix MYDIR

For information on other install options the --help option can be used:

  python setup.py install --help

On Linux systems, the installation of EGADS in the user home directory is encouraged to ensure the proper operation of the EGADS logging system.

If EGADS requirements in term of dependecies are full filled and/or if the user wants to avoid their installation, the use of the following option is encouraged:

  python setup.py install --no-dep
or
  pip install egads --no-dep


Testing
=======

To test the EGADS installation, from within Python, run the following commands:

  >>> import egads
  >>> egads.test()
